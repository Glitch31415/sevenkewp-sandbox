# About this project
The goal for this project is to become a generic Half-Life co-op mod which is easy to customize. Default content and gameplay will stay faithful to classic Half-Life. That means there won't be any: tacticool weapons, HD models, bullet-sponge enemies, etc. This isn't strictly a Sven Co-op clone, but recreating its entities and features is a high priority because nearly all GoldSrc co-op maps were made for sven.

This repo was forked from an early version of [halflife-updated](https://github.com/twhl-community/halflife-updated/tree/8cb9d9eb9016ff56fcba099a09a3b6e6563853b1) (Nov 2021).

# Client Download
[SevenKewp Client Download](https://github.com/wootguy/SevenKewp/releases/latest)

If you're a player, you don't need to install this. Vanilla Half-Life clients are able to play on SevenKewp servers with a few limitations. You can see what's been added to the SevenKewp client in the [Client Features](https://github.com/wootguy/SevenKewp/wiki/Client-Features) wiki. 

### WARNING: USE CUSTOM CLIENTS AT YOUR OWN RISK

Executables distributed outside of Steam are subject to Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) detection. Running this client may trigger VAC protections and result in a permanent VAC ban on your Steam account.

That said, I have observed players using the [HLBugfixed](https://github.com/tmp64/BugfixedHL-Rebased) and [Adrenaline Gamer](https://openag.pro/) clients for one year on my secure server without them being VAC banned. According to my understanding of the [VAC documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/anticheat), executables need to be manually reported as a cheat to Valve for its signature to be detected. I have not added cheats to this client.


# Server Download
The server doesn't have any release binaries available yet. You can try downloading binaries from the [Actions tab](https://github.com/wootguy/SevenKewp/actions) but you'll likely need to build everything yourself, especially on Linux. There are some basic instructions in the [Server Setup](https://github.com/wootguy/SevenKewp/wiki/Server-Setup) wiki.

Make an issue if you have trouble. I might not be very helpful until there's an official release, but I'd like to know what issues people are having.
